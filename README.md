# JaiProfiler

This is the jai version of the C++ Instrumentor project:
https://github.com/zjrubin/Visual_Profiler/blob/master/Instrumentor.cpp

It basically creates a JSON file in which is logged all timing information.
That JSON file can be used in tools like Chrome tracing to help visualize the
timings.

Chrome tracing can be accessed by typing "chrome://tracing" in the url of
Google Chrome.
